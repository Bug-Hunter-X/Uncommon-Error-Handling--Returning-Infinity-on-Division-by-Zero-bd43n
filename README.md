This repository demonstrates a unique approach to handling division by zero errors in Python. Instead of raising a ZeroDivisionError exception, the function returns positive infinity (float('inf')).  This strategy can be beneficial in certain contexts where infinity is a valid and interpretable result. The included code provides examples illustrating this technique and its potential applications.  The bugSolution.py offers an alternative handling method.
